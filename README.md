# 2D-Game-Engine
A simple, top-down, tile-based game engine. Remove files from images/music folders and place in same folder as .java files to run.

 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a tile-based game engine,
 which are commonly used on many old school games, particularly RPGs, can
 be programmed from the ground up. This project is half love letter to those
 old school games and half merely a project I started to sharpen my 
 object-oriented programming skills.
              
 PennDraw is present merely for basic drawing functionality. Tile is 
 this game's atomic object, in that TileBoard consists of a bunch of Tiles.
 Player is exactly what you would expect; this is the object the user controls.
 Game manipulates both Player and TileBoard to simulate the engine.
 SampleClass allows you to play a sample game as an example of what
 can be created with the engine. It also allows the user to see how to 
 populate and start up a new Game.
